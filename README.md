# Skin Cancer Detection.

This project presents a deep learning-based image classification system to detect and classify various types of skin cancer using dermatoscopic images. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), this project aims to provide an efficient and accurate tool to assist dermatologists in early diagnosis of skin cancer.

---

## 🌐 Project Overview

The classification model is trained on the HAM10000 dataset containing dermatoscopic images of skin lesions. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, augmentation, class balancing using SMOTE, CNN-based model building, and performance evaluation using multiple metrics.
